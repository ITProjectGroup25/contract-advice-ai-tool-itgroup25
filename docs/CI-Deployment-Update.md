# CI Deployment Configuration Update

## Issue
Duplicate deployments were occurring:
- Vercel GitHub integration automatically deploys on every push
- CI workflow also manually triggered Vercel deployment
- Result: Two deployments for every push

## Solution
Removed manual Vercel deployment from CI workflow since Vercel GitHub integration handles it automatically.

## Changes Made

### Modified: `.github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml`

**Before:**
```yaml
deploy-vercel:
  needs: lint-test-build
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Deploy to Vercel
      run: npx vercel deploy --prod --token ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```

**After:**
```yaml
# Vercel deployment is handled automatically via Vercel GitHub integration
# No manual deployment needed in CI
```

## Current CI Workflow

The CI now focuses on **code quality** only:

1. **Install dependencies**
2. **Run tests** (`npm test` - 109 tests)
3. **Lint code** (`npm run lint`)
4. **Type check** (`npm run typecheck`)

**Deployment** is handled automatically by Vercel GitHub integration.

## Benefits

✅ **No duplicate deployments**  
✅ **Faster CI execution** (no deployment step)  
✅ **Simpler CI configuration**  
✅ **Leverages Vercel's native GitHub integration**  
✅ **Automatic preview deployments for PRs**

## Vercel Projects

Two projects are deployed:
1. **contract-advice-ai-tool-itgroup25** - Main application
2. **contract-advice-ai-tool-itgroup25-frontend** - Frontend workspace

Both are automatically deployed via Vercel GitHub integration.
